                Dear Jannah,
            </p>
            <p class="content-letter" style="text-indent: 1.5em;">
                As of writing this, you have lived for 5840 days. 15 of those are your birthdays. Each of those birthdays probably has a special  and fond memory embeded to you, and maybe some that are not to your liking. Even when you started losing affection for some of your birthdays, every step towards that "plus 1" to your age is a goal that commemorates of your time living. A birthday is something to feel special and proud about as it extends from being a day of aging up, to appreciating the self for accomplishing things within a year.
            </p>
            <p class="content-letter" style="text-indent: 1.5em;">
                Nevertheless, this moment or day may not feel special to you. Some had even wagered if something bad or terrible may happen to you. It may feel as though that you are simply living this day to wake up the next day, as if nothing ever happened.
            </p>
            <p class="content-letter" style="text-indent: 1.5em;">
                16 years is indeed not a huge number, and nothing grandiose to celebrate about. There are more ages worthwhile celebrating like "coming of age" or other birthday milestones. Yet, despite 16 not being a pretentious number to celebrate about, you should feel as though that this day is more special than your other birthdays.
            </p>
            <p class="content-letter" style="text-indent: 1.5em;">
                Jannah, you have endured years-long of hardships and trials that was tested on you by fate or God. To begin with, I have never even thought of accompanying your journey last year, let alone this year. And based on my observation, your incredible resilience and unwavering determination with some stuff is beyond amusement.
            </p>
            <p class="content-letter" style="text-indent: 1.5em;">
                You have been killing your body just to satisfy the likes of some or to fulfill goals and expectations that was placed on you. Jannah is living on extreme pressure from her surroundings. I am genuinely confused how could you endure the environment you are growing up in--and it makes me sad.
            </p>
            <p class="content-letter" style="text-indent: 1.5em;">
                It makes me sad because you are not looking at your birthday as something extremely special to celebrate and look forward about. <span style="font-weight: bold;">There should be a day dedicated in appreciating of all your efforts and hardships.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="content-letter" style="text-indent: 1.5em;">
                Baby, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Happy 16th birthday!</span> Be reminded that today is special, and will ever be special. All of your stresses and frustrations should put to rest for now, and appreciate living for 16 years. I would want to begin your day by saying that I love and appreciate every single bit of you. I know that I may not make this day feel special to you, but do remember that this day is special to me. I have been looking forward to this day for days, weeks, and months now. I have stressed and thought about what to do sa birthday mo and decided "fuck it, a simple convincing letter will do".
            </p>
            <p class="content-letter" style="text-indent: 1.5em;">
                Again, you may not feel that this day is any special, but at the very least, approach this day with joy and appreciation. Trust me, future future future birthdays will become more special, and my goal is to make you appreciate this day, every year, from now on.
            </p>
            <p class="content-letter" style="text-indent: 1.5em;">
                Promise me that you should never feel sad or down today. I really do hope that the beauty of how you appreciate other's birthdays should reflect back to you. As your boyfriend, I will be the first to appreciate, commemorate, and celebrate March 12 as your birthday. And I will be the first to try and make you this day feel special to you through this letter.
            </p>
            <p class="end-letter">
                Happy Birthday my Jannah!
            </p>
